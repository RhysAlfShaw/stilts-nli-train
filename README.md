# stilts-ai-train

training open llm for stilts

# going forward.

- Attach trained model to topstiltsagent.

- can we qunatise the model and retain preformance, so we can use on lower speced device.

- Can the training process we made agnostic to the model of choice?

- improve the training data based on the example in the Stilts documentation.


# Notes on installation

For fast cpu inference we require llama-cpp-python. This requires a C-compiler to build and install.
