        "prompt": "What does this STILTS command do: `stilts tpipe in=input.fits ofmt=csv out=output.csv`?",
        "response": "This command performs a file format conversion. It reads the FITS file `input.fits` and writes its content to a new file named `output.csv`. The `ofmt=csv` flag specifies that the output format should be Comma-Separated Values. This is useful for exporting astronomical data for use in spreadsheet applications or other software that primarily handles text-based files."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Can you explain what `stilts tpipe in=input.vot cmd='head 10'` will do?",
        "response": "This command reads the VOTable file `input.vot` and applies the `head 10` filter. This filter selects only the first 10 rows of the table. Since no output file is specified, the resulting 10-row table will be printed to the standard output in a human-readable text format. It's a common way to quickly inspect the first few entries of a table."

        "prompt": "I have this command: `stilts tpipe in=input.data ifmt=ascii out=output.fits ofmt=fits`. What is its purpose?",
        "response": "This command converts a plain text ASCII file into the FITS format. It explicitly tells STILTS that the input file `input.data` is in ASCII format (`ifmt=ascii`) and that the output file `output.fits` should be in FITS format (`ofmt=fits`). This is often used to convert custom text-based catalogs into a standard astronomical format for use with other tools."

        "prompt": "Explain the action of `stilts tpipe in=input.fits cmd='keepcols \"RA DEC MAG_G\"' out=output.fits`.",
        "response": "This command modifies a FITS table by selecting specific columns. It reads `input.fits` and applies the `keepcols` filter to retain only the 'RA', 'DEC', and 'MAG_G' columns, discarding all others. The resulting table, with just these three columns, is then saved as a new FITS file named `output.fits`. This is useful for creating a smaller, more focused table for a specific analysis."

    {
        "prompt": "What does `stilts tpipe in=input.fits cmd='sort -down FLUX' out=output.fits` accomplish?",
        "response": "This command sorts a table. It reads the FITS file `input.fits` and applies the `sort` filter to reorder all rows based on the 'FLUX' column. The `-down` flag specifies a descending sort, so rows with the highest flux will appear first. The newly sorted table is then saved to `output.fits`. A common use case is to find the brightest objects in a catalog."

        "response": "This command performs a complex filtering operation. It reads `input.fits` and uses `select` to keep only rows that satisfy two conditions simultaneously: the 'CLASS' column must be the string 'GALAXY', and the 'CONFIDENCE' column must be greater than 0.9. The `&&` operator signifies a logical AND. This creates a new 'clean' or high-confidence sample of galaxies, which is then saved to `output.fits`."

        "response": "This is a highly efficient command for finding the 'top N' entries in a table. It combines sorting and selecting the head of the table in one step. It processes `input.fits` by sorting it in descending order (`-down`) based on the 'REDSHIFT' column and immediately selecting the top 20 rows. This is much faster and uses less memory than a separate `sort` followed by a `head` command. The result is a small table of the 20 objects with the highest redshift, saved to `output.fits`."

        "response": "This command calculates statistics on a filtered subset of the data. First, it reads `input.fits` and applies a `select` filter to keep only rows where the 'FLAG' column is equal to 0, which often indicates good quality data. Then, using `omode=stats`, it calculates and prints summary statistics for all numerical columns of that filtered subset. This is a common way to assess the properties of only the 'good' data in a catalog."

        "response": "This command efficiently finds the 50 objects with the lowest 'MAG_G' value (i.e., the brightest). The `sorthead` filter is a specialized, high-performance combination of sorting and selecting the top N rows. Unlike a full `sort`, it only needs to keep track of the top 50 rows it has seen so far, making it much faster and more memory-efficient for finding a small number of extreme values in a very large table."

        "response": "This command creates a new column by summing the values of several other columns. It uses `addcol` to create 'FLUX_TOTAL', where the value for each row is the sum of the values from the 'FLUX_1' through 'FLUX_5' columns for that same row. This is a common way to combine measurements from multiple filters or epochs."

        "response": "This is a multi-stage sampling pipeline for very large files. The `every 10000` filter first creates a sparse but evenly spaced subsample (taking 1 in every 10,000 rows). Then, `randomview` acts on that smaller intermediate table. While `randomview` is primarily a debugging tool, in this context it helps ensure the final selection of 1000 rows is from a randomized view of the pre-filtered set. This combination is a way to get a somewhat random sample without using much memory."

It tells STILTS to use temporary files on disk for caching data during operations that require random access, like a `sort`. This prevents the program from running out of memory when sorting very large files that would not fit into the computer's RAM. The command itself sorts `input.fits` by 'FLUX_G' in descending order."

The `keepcols *_MAG` filter will keep all columns whose names end with '_MAG' (e.g., U_MAG, G_MAG, R_MAG) and discard all columns that do not match this pattern. The asterisk `*` acts as a wildcard for any sequence of characters. This is a convenient way to select a family of related columns."

You should use it when an upstream operation is expensive (e.g., reading a complex or remote file) and a downstream operation needs to read the data multiple times (e.g., a sort or a cross-match).
